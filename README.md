# This is My Style Discord Bot.

 I'm not that good at coding.

 But I made it my own way, and if necessary, you can bring it and use it.
 

# How to use this
  
  #### I use docker. container is anaconda3
  
  #### But it doesn't matter which operating system apt supports.
  #### if do not support apt, find how to install ffmpeg yourself
  
  1. Install python3(version=3.7.4)

  2. Use pip and install this requirements.
  
    pip install -r requirements.txt


  3. Discord bots need ffmpeg to regenerate their voices.
    
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    
    
# RUN!
    python discord_bot.py
